# Build With DSA 🚀

Learning Data Structures & Algorithms through building real, interactive projects. Each day explores a DSA concept with a practical application.

## 📚 Projects

### Day 2: Task Queue Manager 📋
**Concept**: Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)

A visual job scheduler that demonstrates how queues manage tasks:
- ✅ Interactive task queue with FIFO ordering
- ✅ Real-time task processing simulation
- ✅ Animated state transitions
- ✅ Process individually or batch process
- ✅ Task statistics tracking

### Day 3: URL Shortener 🔗
**Concept**: Hash Map (Hash Table / Dictionary)

A fully functional URL shortener demonstrating O(1) hash map operations:
- ✅ Auto-generate or custom short codes
- ✅ O(1) lookup and insertion
- ✅ Click tracking and statistics
- ✅ Hash map visualization
- ✅ URL management (view, visit, delete)

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day03-url-shortener/)** | **[Code](./day03-url-shortener/)**

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Map), HTML5, CSS3

**Key Learnings**:
- Hash map operations: set(), get(), has(), delete()
- O(1) average time complexity
- Hash collision handling
- How bit.ly and TinyURL work

### Day 4: Music Playlist Manager 🎵
**Concept**: Doubly Linked List

Interactive music player demonstrating linked list operations:
- ✅ Add songs at any position (append, prepend, insert after)
- ✅ Player controls (play, pause, next, previous)
- ✅ Visual linked list with prev/next pointers
- ✅ O(1) insertion and deletion
- ✅ Click any song to jump to it
- ✅ Shuffle and manage playlist

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day04-music-playlist/)** | **[Code](./day04-music-playlist/)**

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (Spotify theme)

**Key Learnings**:

### Day 5: Family Tree Explorer 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
**Concept**: Trees (N-ary Tree)

Interactive family tree builder with visual hierarchy:
- ✅ Add family members (root, parent, child, spouse)
- ✅ Beautiful person cards with avatars
- ✅ Visual tree with marriage lines 💕
- ✅ Search by name
- ✅ Find relationships between any 2 people
- ✅ Tree statistics and zoom controls
- ✅ Quick actions from person cards

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day05-family-tree/)** | **[Code](./day05-family-tree/)**

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (Purple gradient theme)

**Key Learnings**:
- Tree data structure (N-ary tree)
- Parent-child pointers
- Recursive traversal
- Height and depth calculations
- Hierarchical data visualization

### Day 6: Social Network Visualizer 👥
**Concept**: Graphs (Undirected Graph with Adjacency List)

Interactive social network with graph algorithms:
- ✅ Add people and create friend connections
- ✅ Interactive canvas - drag nodes to rearrange
- ✅ Find mutual friends (Set intersection)
- ✅ Friend suggestions (friends of friends)
- ✅ Degrees of separation (BFS shortest path)
- ✅ Network statistics and visualization
- ✅ Real-time graph rendering

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day06-social-network/)** | **[Code](./day06-social-network/)**
