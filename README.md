# Build With DSA 🚀

Learning Data Structures & Algorithms through building real, interactive projects. Each day explores a DSA concept with a practical application.

## 📚 Projects

### Day 1: Browser History Navigator 🌐
**Concept**: Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)

A fully functional browser simulator that demonstrates how stacks power navigation:
- ✅ Real website embedding (when allowed)
- ✅ Visual stack representation
- ✅ Back/Forward navigation
- ✅ Smart fallback for blocked sites
- ✅ Smooth animations & modern UI

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day01-stack-browser-history/)** | **[Code](./day01-stack-browser-history/)**

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

**Key Learnings**:
- Stack operations: push(), pop(), peek()
- LIFO principle in action
- How browsers implement history
- State management with data structures

---

### Day 2: Task Queue Manager 📋
**Concept**: Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)

A visual job scheduler that demonstrates how queues manage tasks:
- ✅ Interactive task queue with FIFO ordering
- ✅ Real-time task processing simulation
- ✅ Animated state transitions
- ✅ Process individually or batch process
- ✅ Task statistics tracking

**[Live Demo](https://tyagirohan.github.io/build-with-dsa/day02-queue-task-manager/)** | **[Code](./day02-queue-task-manager/)**

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

**Key Learnings**:
- Queue operations: enqueue(), dequeue(), front()
- FIFO principle in action
- How job schedulers work
- Task processing visualization

## 🎯 About This Series

This series follows the #DSAInPublic approach:
1. **Learn** a DSA concept
2. **Build** something useful/interesting
3. **Host** it live
4. **Share** on LinkedIn with takeaways

**Follow along**: [LinkedIn - Rohan Tyagi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-tyagi-333675202/)

## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

Each project is standalone - no build tools needed:
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to project folder
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tyagirohan/build-with-dsa.git
cd build-with-dsa/day01-stack-browser-history
# Open index.html in browser
```
